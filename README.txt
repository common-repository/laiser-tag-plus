Use Laiser Tag Plus to get semantic data to use as tags and photo for your posts.

== Description ==

Laiser Tag Plus from PCIS provides integration between your WordPress site and the Open Calais web service. Laiser Tag Plus fetches semantic data (people, places, events, etc.) relevant to your content post that you can use as tags to better categorize, sort and identify it. Laiser Tag Plus will also use these tags to search Flickr for appropriately licensed images for you to use in your blog posts. Laiser Tag Plus also provides support for the Open Calais Company PermID tags. These tags are denoted by an orange stripe, or can be filtered via the dropdown menu in the tag suggestion box. Company tags found within the content of a post will automatically link to their PermID page which includes the company information.

=== Features ===

* Automated tag suggestions when creating/editing WordPress content, ideal for blogs or sites where authors want direct control over how they structure each content item they create.
* Open Calais API integration including PermID tags
